# Food Delivery Simulation (C++ Multi Linked List)

## Project Description

This project is a **Food Delivery Simulation System** implemented in **C++** using a **Multi Linked List data structure**. The program simulates how a food delivery platform manages relationships between **Customers**, **Restaurants**, **Drivers**, and **Orders**.

Each **Order** acts as a connector node that links multiple entities at once, which is the core idea of the **multi-linked list algorithm**.

This project is designed for **Data Structures / Algorithms final projects**.


## Project Objectives

* Apply **Multi Linked List** concepts in a real-world scenario
* Practice **dynamic memory allocation** in C++
* Implement **linked list insertion, deletion, and traversal**
* Build an **interactive console-based application using noteblock**
